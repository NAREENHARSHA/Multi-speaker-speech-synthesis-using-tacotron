# Multi-Speaker Speech Synthesis Using Tacotron 2

This project uses Tacotron 2 with speaker embeddings to generate natural, expressive speech for multiple voices. It integrates HiFi-GAN for high-quality waveform synthesis. The model is fine-tuned on a diverse dataset with metadata linking audio samples to speakers. Ideal for personalized voice assistants, audiobooks, and accessibility tools. The system advances multi-speaker TTS with realistic and distinct voice generation.
